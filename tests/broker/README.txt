Creating the SSL Certificate

   $ openssl req \
       -x509 \
       -nodes \
       -days 365 \
       -newkey rsa:2048 \
       -keyout nginx-selfsigned.key \
       -out nginx-selfsigned.crt

req: This subcommand specifies that we want to use X.509 certificate signing
request (CSR) management. The X.509 is a public key infrastructure standard
that SSL and TLS adheres to for its key and certificate management. We want
to create a new X.509 cert, so we are using this subcommand.

-x509: This further modifies the previous subcommand by telling the utility
that we want to make a self-signed certificate instead of generating a
certificate signing request, as would normally happen.

-nodes: This tells OpenSSL to skip the option to secure our certificate with a
passphrase. We need Nginx to be able to read the file, without user
intervention, when the server starts up. A passphrase would prevent this from
happening because we would have to enter it after every restart.

-days 365: This option sets the length of time that the certificate will be
considered valid. We set it for one year here.

-newkey rsa:2048: This specifies that we want to generate a new certificate
and a new key at the same time. We did not create the key that is required to
sign the certificate in a previous step, so we need to create it along with the
certificate. The rsa:2048 portion tells it to make an RSA key that is 2048 bits
long.

-keyout: This line tells OpenSSL where to place the generated private key file
that we are creating.

-out: This tells OpenSSL where to place the certificate that we are creating.
